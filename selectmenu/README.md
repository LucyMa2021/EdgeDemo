# Open UI's `<selectmenu>` demos

The purpose of [Open UI](https://open-ui.org/) is to provide the web platform with UI controls that can be styled and extended by web developers.

The [demos](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/selectmenu/) in this repository show how the new `<selectmenu>` UI control can be used to achieve what was once only possible with custom (and often inaccessible) selects.
